- [ ] Commits are synthetic and tell a story
- [ ] Docstrings must be checked to ensure they are correct.
- [ ] If the increment fixes a bug, the buggy comportment must be covered by a test.
- [ ] All lines of code affected by a commit should be covered with tests
- [ ] A technical documentation must be created or updated.
